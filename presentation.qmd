## Our Dataset {auto-animate="true"}

Our target dataset comes from the `{refugees} R package`, which compiles extensive information on populations that have been strongly displaced from three main sources: UNHCR, UNRWA, and IDMC.

-   "Refugees" dataset from [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md).

## Question 01 {.smaller}

**How have the patterns in refugee populations evolved over time, and how have the stances of American political parties impacted these developments? Analyse the dynamics of refugee migrations towards US political environments.**

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Data Preparation and Pre-processing

-   Using the R dplyr package
-   First aggregate our data by year before summarizing the overall number of refugees
-   Divide these totals into thousands for easier comprehension

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
total_refugee_trends <- population_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_refugees = sum(refugees, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000)  
```

## Analysis 01: Refugee populations over time {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   Expeditious growth of the refugee population over time

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Plot: Total Refugee populations over time with bar plot and trend line, y-axis in 'K'
plot_total_refugees <- ggplot(total_refugee_trends, aes(x = year, y = total_refugees)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.7) +  # Bar plot for yearly trends
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color = "#FF5230", se = FALSE) +  # Trend line for 30-year increase
  labs(title = "Total Refugee Populations Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Number of Refugees (in K)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = min(total_refugee_trends$year), to = 2024, by = 1)) +  # Ensure all years from 2000 to 2024 are included
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 4 / 8)

print(plot_total_refugees)


```

## Analysis 02: Refugee populations over time {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   A small number of refugees have returned over a period of time

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Data Preparation - Aggregate total number of returned refugees by year and convert to thousands (K)
returned_refugee_trends <- population_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(returned_refugees = sum(returned_refugees, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000)  # Convert to thousands

# Plot: Returned Refugee populations over time with bar plot and trend line, y-axis in 'K'
plot2 <- ggplot(returned_refugee_trends, aes(x = year, y = returned_refugees)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.7) +  # Bar plot for yearly trends
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color = "#FF5230", se = FALSE) +  # Trend line for 30-year increase
  labs(title = "Returned Refugee Populations Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Number of Returned Refugees (in K)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = min(returned_refugee_trends$year), to = 2024, by = 1)) +  # Ensure all years from 2000 to 2024 are included
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 4 / 8)

print(plot2)

```

## Analysis 03: Refugees by year and country of origin {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   Top 20 countries with the highest total number of refugees
-   The heigest number of refugee came has come from "Syrian", "Afghanistan" and "South Sudan"

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Question 02

## How the global refugee population fluctuate across the countries? Is their any external factors impact on refugee population like COVID-19 or war or climate change or financial stability?

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}

```

## Images

![Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate.](images/watercolour_sys02_img34_teacup-ocean.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.

External data on US foreign policy changes, political party statements, or major political events will be incorporated, and their temporal alignment with changes in refugee trends will be examined, in order to evaluate the influence of US political parties’ positions.\nExternal Data: US political timelines, shifts in foreign policy, and noteworthy political pronouncements or occurrences pertaining to refugee policies.\nFor Question 02:\n\nThe variables are involved: The following are the primary variables: ‘year’, ‘coo_name’ (destination country name), ‘coa_name’ (asylum country name), and ‘refugees’ (the total number of refugees).\nData Preparation: Gathering Refugee Data: To track trends over time and across various regions, compile the “refugees” data annually and by nation. To have a better understanding of the relative impacts, consider creating refugee estimates by the populations of the countries of origin and asylum. Evaluate and correct any incomplete or missing data; depending on the requirements of the study, this may include imputation or the exclusion of some records.\nAnalysis: Trend analysis can be helped by using time-series analysis to look at the trends in the refugee population over time in each nation and worldwide. Find links between changes in the number of refugees and outside happenings. If the effect of an incident on refugee populations is not instantaneous, this could include lagged correlations. Assess the impact of major external events by comparing refugee trends before, during, and after them. To estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, comparing the number of refugees before and after 2020 may be helpful.\nExternal Data: Information on wars, conflicts, and lengths of time spent in them, gathered from reliable sources such as the Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research and the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme (UCDP). Details about noteworthy climate events from agencies such as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). To evaluate the effects of financial stability, use both national and global economic indicators from the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Details about the COVID-19 pandemic from sources such as the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) and Johns Hopkins University, including a timeline of outbreaks and significant policy interventions."

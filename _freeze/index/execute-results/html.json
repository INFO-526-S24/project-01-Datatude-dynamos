It offers a comprehensive picture of the numerous factors influencing the lives of refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), asylum seekers, stateless people, and more, spanning over 64,000 entries from sources like UNHCR, UNRWA, and IDMC. This research tries to unravel the complex web of variables driving forced migration, from socioeconomic turbulence to environmental calamities and geopolitical upheavals, via thorough investigation.\n\nTwo key topics form the core of our investigation: how changing political ideologies in the US affect refugee trends, and how changes in external occurrences such as pandemics, conflicts, and climate change affect refugee numbers globally. Using time-series analysis and additional statistical techniques, we examine displacement patterns and correlate them with major political changes and global crises in order to identify underlying trends and causal relationships.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis project analyses more than 64,000 data from the {refugees} R package, covering the period from 2010 to 2022, in order to investigate the intricate dynamics of worldwide displacement. The dataset provides a detailed look at the lives of refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), asylum seekers, and stateless people, among others. It is derived from UNHCR, UNRWA, and IDMC and sheds light on the complex dynamics of forced migration. The goal is to identify the complex interactions that exist between outside variables and their impacts on patterns of global displacement, including geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and sociopolitical upheavals.\n\nThe impact of US political positions on refugee trends and the general changes in worldwide refugee populations as a result of external factors like wars, climatic shifts, and health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic are central to our research. We want to analyse the complex relationship between major world events and displacement trends using time-series analysis and statistical evaluations.\n\n## Question 1: How have the patterns in refugee populations evolved over time, and how have the stances of American political parties impacted these developments? Analyse the dynamics of refugee migrations towards US political environments.\n\n### Introduction\n\nOur project's first inquiry explores the complex interplay between international refugee movements and political processes in the United States. We seek to understand how changes in political party ideologies and governmental positions inside the United States may have affected patterns of refugee populations, paying particular attention to historical data from 2000 to 2024. This investigation is based on the theory that political discourse and policy choices coming from the United States can significantly impact worldwide displacement patterns, either by reshaping the geopolitical environment or by changing the country's own refugee accepting policies.\n\n### Approach\n\nWe have adopted a multimodal analytic approach to this subject, combining a comparative assessment of political epochs in the United States with time-series analysis. For clarity and scalability in our visual representations, we first aggregate the overall number of refugees by year, normalizing the data to thousands. We can create a chronological narrative of refugee migrations by layering important political events and changes in the United States over these trends thanks to this basic data. We produce visual aids, such as bar plots and trend lines, using ggplot2 to clarify the relationship between refugee populations and changes in U.S. politics. Our research is further enhanced by the addition of data from returning refugees, which provides insights into the cyclical nature of displacement and resettlement.\n\n### Data Preparation and Pre-processing\n\nThe preparation stage of the data is essential to transforming our data-set into a format that allows for effective analysis. Using the R dplyr package, we first aggregate our data by year before summarizing the overall number of refugees—making sure to divide these totals into thousands for easier comprehension. This procedure is also applied to data pertaining to refugees who have returned, yielding a parallel dataset that illustrates the flow of return movements in addition to original displacements. We also prepare by making the 'year' a numeric variable so that we can use it as an axis in both our static and animated visualization. The careful processing of the data paves the way for an in-depth investigation of the relationship between U.S. political positions and international refugee trends.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data Preparation - Aggregate total number of refugees by year and convert to thousands (K)\ntotal_refugee_trends <- population_data %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarise(total_refugees = sum(refugees, \n                                 na.rm = TRUE) / 1000)  # Convert to thousands\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Analysis 01: Refugee populations over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot: Total Refugee populations over time with bar plot and trend line, y-axis in 'K'\nplot_total_refugees <- ggplot(total_refugee_trends, \n                              aes(x = year, \n                                  y = total_refugees)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", \n           fill = \"skyblue\", \n           alpha = 0.7) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", \n              formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), \n              color = \"#FF5230\", \n              se = FALSE) +  \n  labs(title = \"Total Refugee Populations Over Time\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Refugees (in K)\") +\n   theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + \n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),  \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, \n                                  face = \"bold\"),  \n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +  \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = min(total_refugee_trends$year), \n                                  to = 2024, \n                                  by = 1)) +  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)  \n\n\n# Data Preparation - Aggregate total number of returned refugees by year and convert to thousands (K)\nreturned_refugee_trends <- population_data %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarise(returned_refugees = sum(returned_refugees, \n                                    na.rm = TRUE) / 1000) \n\n# Plot: Returned Refugee populations over time with bar plot and trend line, y-axis in 'K'\nplot2 <- ggplot(returned_refugee_trends, \n                aes(x = year, \n                    y = returned_refugees)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", \n           fill = \"skyblue\", \n           alpha = 0.7) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", \n              formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), \n              color = \"#FF5230\", \n              se = FALSE) +  \n  labs(title = \"Returned Refugee Populations Over Time\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Returned Refugees (in K)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + \n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),  \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, \n                                  face = \"bold\"),  \n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +  \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = min(returned_refugee_trends$year), \n                                  to = 2024, \n                                  by = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) \n```\n:::\n\n\nThe graphic illustrates the changes in overall refugee populations over time using a bar graph that shows annual fluctuations.

The fluctuating trends in refugee populations and asylum seeker data underscore the significant impact of political ideologies and policies on global displacement and migration patterns. Moreover, the cyclical nature of refugee returns and the concentration of refugees from specific countries highlight the complex interplay between global crises and US political responses.\n\n## Question 2: How the global refugee population fluctuate across the countries? Is their any external factors impact on refugee population like COVID-19 or war or climate change or financial stability?\n\n### Introduction\n\nUnderstanding global refugee patterns is crucial for addressing humanitarian challenges and devising effective policy responses. In this analysis, we aim to explore the dynamics of refugee movements across nations over time, focusing on key variables such as `'year'`, `'coo_name'`, `'coa_name'`, and `'refugees'` data. By examining annual refugee data normalized against population statistics, we seek to uncover trends and link them to significant world events, including conflicts, climate disasters, and economic changes.\n\n### Approach\n\nOur approach involves gathering comprehensive data from various sources and applying time-series techniques to analyze refugee patterns. We utilize datasets from international organizations and government agencies, supplemented by demographic and socio-economic indicators. Through statistical analysis and data visualization using tools like ggplot2, we aim to discern patterns in refugee movements and understand the influence of external factors such as wars, climate disasters, and economic stability\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Glimpse of process Function\"}\nprocessRefugees <- function (dataset, unique_countries) {\n  filtered_data <- dataset |>\n    # filtering only country name, year and refugees columns\n    select(coo_name, year, \n           refugees) |>\n    bind_rows(\n      anti_join(unique_countries, dataset, by = c(\"region\" = \"coo_name\")) |>\n        # adding year and number of refugees for that specific year as NA\n        mutate(year = as.integer(dataset[1, \n                                         \"year\"]), \n               refugees = NA)\n    ) |>\n    \n    mutate(\n      coo_name = case_when(\n        coo_name == \"United States of America\" ~ \"USA\",\n        coo_name == \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" ~ \"UK\",\n        coo_name == \"Iran (Islamic Rep. of)\" ~ \"Iran\",\n        coo_name == \"Palestinian\" ~ \"Palestine\",\n        coo_name == \"Serbia and Kosovo: S/RES/1244 (1999)\" ~ \"Serbia\",\n        coo_name == \"Türkiye\" ~ \"Turkey\",\n        coo_name == \"Congo\" ~ \"Congo\",\n        coo_name == \"Dem.

This period may show increased migrations from the Middle East, particularly Syria, due to the Syrian Civil War beginning in 2011. Other regions might also exhibit changes due to local conflicts or economic instability.\n\n### Analysis 02: Economic / Climate Conditions in Year 2016-2019\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/refugee_map_2020.jpg){fig-align='center' width=2469}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe refugee crisis in Europe might influence numbers, with potential spillover effects on US Refugee/asylum applications.

Post-pandemic recovery may lead to an increase in migrations as countries lift travel bans. The situation in Afghanistan post-US withdrawal could result in an increase in refugees from that region.\n\n### Plot-Alpha\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/worldmap_plot.gif){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile not typically classified as refugees, many Chinese nationals seek to leave China for economic opportunities. The relationship between China and the USA, including U.S. immigration policy, can influence refugee flows. Policies that allow for a greater number of asylum applications or provide specific provisions for individuals from China can result in higher refugee numbers. Additionally, there may be specific legislative acts or policies targeting the protection of certain groups from China, which could lead to an increase in accepted refugee applications.\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe analysis underscores the intricate relationship between global refugee movements and external factors like conflicts, economic conditions, and climate changes. The varying trends across different periods highlight how events like wars, financial crises, and pandemics significantly shape refugee patterns. This insight is crucial for formulating responsive and informed humanitarian policies to address the complexities of global displacement.\n## Challenges faced\n\n-   Data only available from 2010 not before that\n-   Animation and frame rate selection.\n-   Error in data type and rendering method selection of gif during animation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe analyse refugee patterns over time across nations by analyzing `'year'`, `'coo_name'`, `'coa_name'`, and `'refugees'` data. To acquire a clearer understanding of the repercussions, we will gather annual refugee data by nation and normalize it against population statistics. Time-series techniques will be used in the study to find trends and link them to important world events including wars, climate disasters, and changes in the economy. Our goal is to quantify the influence of these events on displacement by examining refugee trends around them. The context provided by external data, such as conflict histories, records of climate events, economic indicators, and epidemic timelines, will help to create a complete picture of the variables influencing global refugee movements. This analysis of the **`{refugees}`** dataset highlights the significant influence of outside factors on patterns of worldwide displacement throughout the last ten years. We have learned how major changes in refugee and displacement patterns have been fueled by geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and global crises through thorough investigation. The results emphasize not only how urgent it is to deal with the underlying causes of displacement but also how important it is to have strong, well-informed responses to the intricate problems associated with forced migration. These kinds of data-driven analysis are essential for developing humanitarian actions and policies that effectively address the world's growing displacement crisis.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\] Title: Refugees, Source: tidytuesday, Link: <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md>\n\n\\[2\\] Analyzed some of the global trends of refugee population from UNHCR - \"[https://www.unhcr.org/us/global-trends\"](https://www.unhcr.org/us/global-trends\")\n\n\\[3\\] Quarto, For documentation and presentation - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html)\n\n\\[4\\] ggplot, For understanding of different plot - [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)\n\n\\[5\\] Our Presentation logo - [logo](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/family-people-and-earth-nature-logo-vector-21169176)\n",

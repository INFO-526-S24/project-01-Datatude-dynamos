This study intends to delve into the patterns of refugee migration to the **`USA`**, tracing movements from various countries over time. Through analyzing refugee data on an annual basis and adjusting for population figures, our goal is to identify trends and correlate them with major global occurrences such as **wars**, **environmental crises**, **Policy changes**, and **economic shifts.**\n\n# Question 01\n\n## How have the patterns in refugee populations evolved over time, and how have the stances of American political parties impacted these developments? Analyse the dynamics of refugee migrations towards US political environments. {.smaller}\n\n## Data Preparation and Pre-processing\n\n-   Using the R dplyr package\n-   First aggregate our data by year before summarizing the overall number of refugees\n-   Divide these totals into thousands for easier comprehension\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntotal_refugee_trends <- population_data %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarise(total_refugees = sum(refugees, \n                                 na.rm = TRUE) / 1000)  \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis: Refugee populations over time {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n-   Expeditious growth of the refugee population over time\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis: Refugee populations over time {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n-   A small number of refugees have returned over a period of time\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis: Refugees by year and country of origin {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n-   Top 10 countries with the highest total number of refugees\n-   The maximum number of refugee came has come from **Syrian**, **Afghanistan** and **South Sudan**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis: Refugees by year and country of origin {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n-   Top 10 countries with the highest total number of asylum seekers\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis: Refugee populations over time with US political context. {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n-   A small number of refugees have returned over a period of time\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/anim_plot1.gif){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 02\n\n#### How does the global refugee population's migration to the USA vary across different countries and years? Are there external factors, such as COVID-19, war, climate change, financial stability, or policy changes, that influence the number of refugees seeking asylum in the USA?\n\n-   This presentation aims to showcase the evolution of the refugee population migrating to the USA from various countries annually, spanning from 2010 to 2022.\n\n## Approach\n\n-   Define Pre-processing Function:\n\n-   Defined a function `processRefugees` to preprocess the refugee dataset. Selected relevant columns and handled missing data. Rename countries to standard names and created a categorical variable for grouping. Returned the pre-processed dataset. Process Data and Create Plots:\n\n-   We Split population data into decades. Applied pre-processing function to each decade's data. Defined a function `generateRefugeePlot` to generate a ggplot map plot. Used the pre-processed data to create plots for each year.\n\n**Code**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Glimpse of process Function\"}\nprocessRefugees <- function (dataset, unique_countries) {\n  filtered_data <- dataset |>\n    # filtering only country name, year and refugees columns\n    select(coo_name, \n           year, \n           refugees) |>\n    bind_rows(\n      # anti_join() is used to return only the rows from the first dataset that isn't having matching rows in the second dataset based on specified key columns\n      anti_join(unique_countries, \n                dataset, \n                by = c(\"region\" = \"coo_name\")) |>\n        # adding year and number of refugees for that specific year as NA\n        mutate(year = as.integer(dataset[1, \n                                         \"year\"]), \n               refugees = NA)\n    ) |>\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    mutate(\n      coo_name = case_when(\n        coo_name == \"United States of America\" ~ \"USA\",\n        coo_name == \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" ~ \"UK\",\n        coo_name == \"Iran (Islamic Rep. of)\" ~ \"Iran\",\n        coo_name == \"Palestinian\" ~ \"Palestine\",\n        coo_name == \"Serbia and Kosovo: S/RES/1244 (1999)\" ~ \"Serbia\",\n        coo_name == \"TÃ¼rkiye\" ~ \"Turkey\",\n        coo_name == \"Congo\" ~ \"Congo\",\n        coo_name == \"Dem.

ongoing issues in countries like Somalia and china.\n-   This period may show increased migrations from the Middle East, particularly Syria, due to the Syrian Civil War beginning in 2011.\n-   Other regions might also exhibit changes due to local conflicts or economic instability.\n:::\n\n## Economic / Climate Conditions in Year 2016-2019\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Plot

worldwide due to travel restrictions and border closures.\n-   Post-pandemic recovery may lead to an increase in migrations as countries lift travel bans.\n-   The situation in Afghanistan post-US withdrawal could result in an increase in refugees from that region.\n:::\n\n## EUREKAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### 2010-2022\n\n![](images/worldmap_plot.gif){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"850\" height=\"600\"}\n\n#### Study\n\n-   While not typically classified as refugees, many Chinese nationals seek to leave China for economic opportunities\n-   The relationship between China and the USA, including U.S. immigration policy, can influence refugee flows. Policies that allow for a greater number of asylum applications or provide specific provisions for individuals from China can result in higher refugee numbers. Additionally, there may be specific legislative acts or policies targeting the protection of certain groups from China, which could lead to an increase in accepted refugee applications.\n:::\n\n## Challenges faced\n\n-   Data only available from 2010 not before that\n-   Animation and frame rate selection.\n-   Error in data type and rendering method selection of gif during animation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing annual refugee data alongside global events, our study reveals how geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and economic changes drive global displacement patterns.
